non-functional requirements:


1-Performance:

The system should respond to user actions, such as logout, registration, and call identification, within an acceptable time frame.
The system should handle a large number of concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
Flash messaging should have low latency to ensure real-time communication.

2-Security:

User data, including contact information and call recordings, should be securely stored and protected from unauthorized access.
User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to ensure the privacy and integrity of user accounts.
The system should support secure communication protocols to protect sensitive information during transmission.

3-Reliability:

The system should have high availability, ensuring that users can access the service whenever they need it.
It should have mechanisms to recover from failures and handle errors gracefully without losing user data or compromising system functionality.
Call recording should be reliable and accurate, ensuring that all necessary calls are recorded without loss or corruption of data.

4-Usability:

The user interface should be intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible to a wide range of users.
The system should provide clear and meaningful error messages to assist users in troubleshooting issues.
Language localization should be supported to accommodate users from different regions.

5-Scalability:

The system should be able to handle an increasing number of users, contacts, and call logs without significant performance degradation.
It should support the addition of new features and modules without requiring extensive modifications to the existing system architecture.

6-Maintainability:

The system should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future enhancements, bug fixes, and maintenance tasks.
Code readability, consistency, and adherence to coding standards should be maintained throughout the development process.

7-Compatibility:

The system should be compatible with different operating systems, web browsers, and devices to accommodate a wide range of users.
Integration with external systems or APIs, such as third-party contact databases or messaging services, should be supported.

8-Data Integrity:

The system should ensure the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of user data, including contact information, call logs, and user profiles.
Proper backup and recovery mechanisms should be in place to prevent data loss or corruption.
These are just a few examples of non-functional requirements that can be associated with the given functional requirements. The actual non-functional requirements may vary depending on the specific needs and context of the system being developed.
